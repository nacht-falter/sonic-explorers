# **Sonic Explorers** User Stories

[Go back to README.md](../README.md)

All user stories are categorized into four themes:

- [User Authentication and Profile Management](#theme-user-authentication-and-profile-management)
- [Sound Management](#theme-sound-management)
- [Discovering Sounds](#theme-discovering-sounds)
- [User Interaction](#theme-user-interaction)
- [User Experience](#theme-user-experience)
