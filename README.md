## Design Process

I approached the design process of the *Sonic Explorers* app from a user-centered perspective, following the five planes of user experience. The design process of the frontend application had to go hand in hand with the design process of the backend API, which is documented here: [Sonic Explorers API Design Process](https://github.com/sonic-explorers-api#design-process).

### Strategy Plane

**Sonic Explorers** is a social media app dedicated to recording and sharing sounds. It's target audience are people who are interested in sound and want to share their experiences with others. Its main goal is to provide a playful and engaging way of encouraging a more conscious approach to the sounds in our environment.

The use of **geolocation and maps** is an essential part of the application. Due to the ephemeral nature of sound, recordings often feel disconnected from the original situation in which they were recorded. Adding location data to a sound can help to link sound recordings to real places and situations, which makes it easier for users to relate to them. At the same time, placing sounds on a map allows users to explore sounds from different places and discover new sounds around them. It also encourages users to get out and explore interesting sounds in the world.

**Tagging sounds** is another important feature of the application. It allows users to organize and find sounds. It also encourages users to think about the acoustic qualities of the sounds they encounter and to reflect on them. Although it can be quite challenging to find appropriate words to describe a sound, other than just naming the sound's source, thinking about this can be a first step to a more conscious approach to sound.

The **social interaction** features of the application (following other users, liking and commenting on sounds) are intended to encourage users to engage with each other and to create a community of people who are interested in sound.

### Scope Plane

For the scope of the project, separate sets of user stories were created [for the backend](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api/blob/main/docs/USERSTORIES.md) and [for the frontend](docs/USERSTORIES.md) part of the application with the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in mind.

### Structure Plane

The planning of the structure plane of the project involved thinking about the different parts of the project and their interactions. Since most of that planning had to be done before implementing the backend part of the project, the process of planning the structure of the backend (database, models, API endpoints) is documented here: [Sonic Explorers API Design Process](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api#design-process).

#### Main components

In order to implement all [features](#existing-features) within the current scope of the project, I planned the frontend application with the following main components:

### Skeleton Plane

The layout of the application was designed with a mobile-first approach, since it is intended to be mainly used as a mobile application. But it is also designed to be fully responsive and can be used on all screen sizes.

The user interface of the application consists of three main sections:

- A top navigation bar including the following elements:
    - The Sonic Explorers logo (and the title on larger screens)
    - Sign-up and sign-in links for signed-out users
    - A sound upload button and a user dropdown menu for signed-in users
- A bottom navigation bar with links to the main pages of the application (Explore, Map, Feed, Favourites, News)
- A content section for displaying the contents of the current page

Originally, the user interface of the application was planned with a dropdown navigation menu at the top of the page, as can be seen on the wireframes below. During the development process, I decided to use a bottom navigation bar for the main pages of the application to make the application more mobile-friendly and make it feel more like a mobile app rather than a website. This decision is not reflected in the wireframes.

### Surface Plane

#### Logo

The first step of planning for the surface plane was to design a logo for the application. After playing around with different ideas, I settled on a circle divided in two halves by a jagged line, which looks like a soundwave but also like a mountain range, representing the sound aspect as well as the exploratory aspect of the application. I chose pink and yellow as the main colors of the logo. 

![Sonic Explorers Logo](docs/sonic-explorers-logo.webp)

#### Colors

In accordance with the application logo, the main colors of the application used for links, buttons and other elements are pink and yellow.

<!-- Display colors in markdown: https://stackoverflow.com/a/41247934 -->
![#d939ab](https://placehold.co/100x100/d939ab/d939ab.png) Primary color: #d939ab

![#ffc101](https://placehold.co/100x100/ffc101/ffc101.png) Secondary color: #ffc101

#### Fonts

I chose [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) as the main font for the application for its clean look and good legibility. It is used for all text elements on the page except for headings.

For headings, I chose [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2), which has a more playful and futuristic look.

## Agile Methodology

### GitHub Issues and Projects as Agile Tools

[GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) and [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) were used as tools for Agile methodology.

- I used [**Issues**](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to define user stories and created Assessment Criteria and Tasks for each user story.

- I categorized all user stories by **[Themes](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/labels?q=THEME)** and **[Epics](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/labels?q=EPIC)** and used labels to mark user stories accordingly.

- All user stories were prioritized using the MoSCoW prioritization technique with the following project-wide priorities:

  https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/labels/PRIORITY%3A%20Must-Have https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/labels/PRIORITY%3A%20Should-Have https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/labels/PRIORITY%3A%20Could-Have https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/labels/PRIORITY%3A%20Won%27t-Have

- I used **Milestones** for the [Product Backlog](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/milestone/1) and for adding user stories to [Sprints](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/milestones?state=closed).

- [Projects](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/projects?query=is%3Aclosed) were used for tracking user stories within each iteration.

- [Project workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically) were used to automatically add user stories in a sprint to the To-do column of the corresponding project board.

- For sprint-wide prioritization, a [custom priority field](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields) was created.

### Sprint Planning

The development process for the API project was planned with six timeboxed sprints of three days each. User stories were assigned to sprints with the MVP in mind, while making sure not to assign more than 60% Must-Have user stories to a sprint.

## Technologies Used

### Frameworks and Languages

The application was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a frontend JavaScript library. The React project was initialized with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Additional JavaScript and React Libraries

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for making HTTP requests to the API.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling and layout.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing.
- [React Infinite Scroll Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) for implementing infinite scroll.
- [JWT Decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode) for decoding JSON Web Tokens.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for displaying maps.

## Testing

All Testing procedures for the application have been documented here: [Testing Documentation](docs/TESTING.md)

## Deployment

The application was deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com). A live version of the application can be found at https://sonic-explorers-e821805686e9.herokuapp.com/.

Please follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. Deploy your own version of the [Sonic Explorers API](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api) by following the [deployment instructions for the Sonic Explorers API](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api#deployment).

2. Clone or fork this repository. For forking it, go to https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers/, click on `Fork` and follow the instructions. For cloning the repository, run `git clone https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers.git` in your terminal.

    </hr>

3. Go to the repository folder and edit the file `src/api/axiosDefaults.js`. In the file, change the value of `axios.defaults.baseURL` to the URL of your deployed API. You can find the URL by clicking on your API app from the Heroku dashboard and then copying the URL from the `Open app` button.

4. If you haven't done so yet, login to your Heroku account at https://heroku.com. Now start a new app from the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com) by clicking on `New` and then on `Create new app`.

    <details>

    ![Open app](docs/deployment/open-app.png)

    </details>

    If everything went well, you should see the *Sonic Explorers* landing page. If you can see the landing page but no content is loaded from the API (i.e., the loading spinner keeps spinning) double check if you have correctly set the `CLIENT_ORIGIN` config variable on your API project [as described here](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api#deployment). If you still can't see any content, make sure you provided the correct URL for your API as described in step 3 or check the console for error messages.

## Credits

### Inspiration

The idea for this project goes back to a student project initiated by me and other musicology students at the University of Freiburg in 2014. The original project was called *SoundCaching* because it was inspired by [Geocaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching), an outdoor activity where players use GPS to find hidden containers called geocaches. While the original project was never actually realized, the current version of *Sonic Explorers* is strongly influenced by the ideas behind it. 

### Sources

#### Code

The initial setup and the basic structure of the application are based on the instructions from the [Code Institute *Moments* walkthrough project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments). All code from the walkthrough project has been customized and adapted to the specific circumstances of this project. Since the walkthrough project focuses on uploading and sharing images instead of sounds, all audio-related functionality had to be implemented from scratch. I also added additional features not covered by the walkthrough project, such as geolocation and a tagging system, as well as all functionality revolving around notifications and reports.

During the development of the application, I made extensive use of the following documentation. Documentation pages are referenced in the code, where I used them:

- [React documentation](https://react.dev/)
- [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- [React Bootstrap documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html)
- [React Leaflet documentation](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- [WaveSurfer.js documentation](https://wavesurfer.xyz/docs/)
- [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [React Testing Library documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

All other sources used during development are listed below. All code from these sources has been thoroughly reviewed, understood and adapted to the specific circumstances of this project. References to these sources can also be found in the code.
